**How many sequences are there in the fasta file?**

we know that each sequence name will start with a special character, ``>``. So we can 

1. find lines that start with ``>``
2. count the total number of these lines 

Remember we can find specific characters in a file with ``grep``? For example, to find all instances of ``GGCG`` in the ``metags/small_meta.fa`` file, we could::

	grep "GGCG" metags/small_meta.fa

To find sequences, we know that each sequence will start with a special character, ``>``.

``^>`` matches line which starts with ``>``, the charter(s) after ``^``. So we are going to find this pattern with ``grep``, and pipe (``|``) these lines to the next command ``wc -l``::

	grep "^>" metags/small_meta.fa | wc -l
