Modified from a previous `tutorial <http://blast-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ncbi/index.html>`_

==============================
Section 1. Learning objectives
==============================
This is a tutorial for working with sequencing data and running a program in shell.  

Objectives
==========
The learning objectives for this tutorial are as follows:

1.  To be able to navigate and read a sequencing file in shell.
2.  To be able to download, install, and run a command line bioinformatics tool.
3.  To be able to search a BLAST output file.

Pre-requisites
==============
You will need to know some things prior to this tutorial:

1.  Access and login to an Amazon EC2 instance or similar ubuntu-based server
2.  A brief introduction to shell

Mission
=======
Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to identify **nitrogen fixation genes (nifh genes)** from **sequencing DNA from soils**.

**Details:**
	You have been delivered three dogma-changing metagenomes (sequencing datasets) originating from three different Iowa crop soils (corn, soybean, and prairie).  You are interested in identifying nitrogen fixation genes that are associated with native bacteria in these soils.  Nitrogen fixation is a natural process performed by bacteria that converts nitrogen in the atmosphere into a form that is usable for plants.  If we can optimize natural nitrogen fixation, our hope is to reduce nitrogen fertilizer inputs that may contribute to the eutrophication of downstream waters (e.g., dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico).

**Methods:**
	Use **BLAST (basic local alignment search tool)** to compare sequences from soil metagenome files with a set of know nifh gene sequences.  

=======================
Section 2. Set up BLAST
=======================

What is BLAST?
==============
From *Wikipedia*: 

	"BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) is an algorithm and program for **aligning and comparing** primary biological sequence information, such as the amino-acid sequences of proteins or the nucleotides of DNA and/or RNA sequences. 

	A BLAST search enables a researcher to compare a **subject protein or nucleotide sequence (called a query)** with a **library or database of sequences**, and identify library sequences that resemble the query sequence above a certain threshold."

Preparation
=============
We need to download and install the BLAST package before using it. I am going to go back to the ``home`` directory, make a new folder ``tools``, and set up BLAST there::

	cd ~
	mkdir tools
	ls    # you should be able to see your tools folder

We will navigate to the ``tools`` folder::

	cd tools


Download BLAST
==============
Let's download the compressed BLAST package after navigating to the folder you prefered by::

	wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/LATEST/ncbi-blast-2.11.0+-x64-linux.tar.gz

Find more BLAST package download and install information from `here
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279671/>`_.

Install BLAST
=============
We can install BLAST by extracting the downloaded compressed package with ``tar`` command::

	tar -xvf ncbi-blast-2.11.0+-x64-linux.tar.gz	# extract from the compressed package

.. note::
	
	**Command syntax:** ``utility/command flag argument``

	- Utility/Command: The command you run to do your work, e.g., ``tar``
	- Flag: Options or preferences for commands; commands may use default settings if flags are not defined; Flag normall starts with one or two dashes ``-`` which depends on the command, e.g., ``-xvf``
	- Argument: Arguments tell the command exactly what you want for a specific action. E.g., ``ncbi-blast-2.11.0+-x64-linux.tar.gz``


Yay, we have a brand new BLAST installed! Let's try it out::
	
	blastn -help

Oops... ``Command 'blastn' not found...`` But we just did install BLAST! It seems like something is going wrong. Let's see if we can find the path/location of ``blastn`` with ``which`` command::

	which blastn


No path found. I already checked the ``ncbi-blast-2.11.0+`` folder and know where ``blastn`` is stored. Let's try to call "help" for ``blastn`` with its path::

	~/tools/ncbi-blast-2.11.0+/bin/blastn -help

A lot of helpful information is showing. It worked this time, but we need to use the whole path of ``blastn``. Hey, we don't need to use the whole path for ``grep``, or ``ls``, or ``pwd``. Why only BLAST?

There is an environment variable ``PATH``. If you add the path of executable code files to ``PATH``, the system will automatically know where to find this executable script when you run it. So that we can run these scripts on the command line in other directories without knowing and typing the whole path to them. Let's see if bash knows where to find ``grep``::

	which grep

It does! Because the path of ``grep`` is already in ``PATH`` variable.

We want to add the path of ``blastn`` to the environment ``PATH``. This will allow us to use ``blastn`` on the command line in other directories without knowing and typing the whole path to ``blastn``. 

Let's navigate to the actual executable code scripts folder of BLAST, and add the path of these scripts to ``PATH``::

	# navigate to the bin folder under BLAST
	cd ncbi-blast-2.11.0+/bin	
	ls

	pwd
	export PATH=$PATH:/home/ubuntu/tools/ncbi-blast-2.11.0+/bin	# Add the path of the tool to environment PATH
	echo $PATH


Awesome! Now we have our BLAST tool set up. We will start the process of sequence analysis with BLAST in the next section.

Before moving on, these are some basic introduction about BLAST commands:

+---------------+-----------------------+----------------------+
| BLAST command |    query              | database             |
+===============+=======================+======================+
| blastn        | nucleotide            |nucleotide            |
+---------------+-----------------------+----------------------+
| blastp        | protein               |protein               |
+---------------+-----------------------+----------------------+
| blastx        | translated nucleotide |protein               |
+---------------+-----------------------+----------------------+
| tblastn       | protein               |translated nucleotide |
+---------------+-----------------------+----------------------+


=========================
Section 3. BLAST Analysis
=========================

Overview
================
Navigate to the data folder that we will be working in today::

	cd cd ~/blast_crash_course/materials/blast-tutorial/data/
	ls 
	ls -R # list recursively directory tree

The strucure of this folder is as below:

.. image:: uruguay_data_folder.png
	:scale: 60 %

We will go though BLAST by doing two projects today:

Project 1. Understand BLAST with small datasets

	Align ``small_meta.fa`` to ``single_gene.fa``

Project 2. Apply BLAST on real datasets

	Align ``corn.fa``, ``prairie.fa``, and ``soybean.fa`` to ``nifh-ref.fa`` separately


Project 1. Understand BLAST with small datasets
===============================================

Navigate to ``small_blast`` directory by::

	cd /home/ubuntu/blast_crash_course/materials/blast-tutorial/data/small_blast

Task 1.1. Explore the data
--------------------------

**What are in this folder?**

Let's see what we have in this folder::

	ls
	ls *	# List all subdirectories


- ``gene_db/``: a folder contains nucleotide sequence file ``single_gene.fa`` --- **database**

- ``metags/``: a folder contains metagenome file "small_meta.fa" --- **query**

- **Objective**: Compare and align sequences from ``small_meta.fa`` to ``single_gene.fa`` database


**How does sequence file look like?**

Let's look at the query file and the gene file::
	
	head gene_db/single_gene.fa
	head metags/small_meta.fa
	

**fasta**: One of the most common sequence file types. Fasta files may have extension as ``.fasta`` or ``.fna`` or ``.fa``

.. image:: fasta.png

Learn more about sequencing file format from `here
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/submitformats/#fastq-files>`_.


**How many sequences are there in the fasta file?**

we know that each sequence name will start with a special character, ``>``. So we can 

1. find lines that start with ``>``
2. count the total number of these lines 

Remember we can find specific characters in a file with ``grep``? For example, to find all instances of ``GGCG`` in the ``metags/small_meta.fa`` file, we could::

	grep "GGCG" metags/small_meta.fa


``^>`` matches line which starts with ``>``, the charter(s) after ``^``. To get the total number of sequences in a fasta file, we are going to find the lines that start with ``>`` pattern with ``grep "^>"``, and pipe (``|``) these lines to the next command ``wc -l`` for counting::

	grep "^>" metags/small_meta.fa | wc -l


Task 1.2. Make database
-----------------------
Making a database for genes is a smart way to index the gene sequences so that it can search and compare metagenome sequences (query) with gene sequences much faster.

To make a database of the single gene sequences:: 

    # Usage: makeblastdb -in <nifh-db> -dbtype nucl -out <nifh-db>
    
    cd /home/ubuntu/blast_crash_course/materials/blast-tutorial/data/small_blast
    makeblastdb -in gene_db/single_gene.fa -dbtype nucl -out gene_db/single_gene.fa

    # the database looks like:
    ls gene_db/


Task 1.3. BLAST
---------------
Now we can BLAST the metagenome files to single gene database. I would suggest something like the following variables, note that the ``-outfmt 6`` flag identifies a tabular output::

    # Usage: blastn -query <metag file> -db <db file> -out <name of output> -outfmt 6
    
    cd /home/ubuntu/blast_crash_course/materials/blast-tutorial/data/small_blast
    
    blastn -query metags/small_meta.fa -db gene_db/single_gene.fa -out metags/small_meta.fa-blast-output.txt -outfmt 6


We can have a good understanding of ``-outfmt 6`` format from this `webpage
<https://sites.google.com/site/wiki4metagenomics/tools/blast/blastn-output-format-6>`_. You just did your first BLAST in shell, congratulations! Let's warm up with some exercises and then we will work with some real sequencing data. 


Exercise 1.1
------------

Navigate to the folder ``/home/ubuntu/blast_crash_course/materials/blast-tutorial/data/big_blast`` for Project 2 first, then list files and directories in this folder::

	cd /home/ubuntu/blast_crash_course/materials/blast-tutorial/data/big_blast
	ls
	ls *	# List all subdirectories

**Exercise**:

1.1.1. Show the last 40 lines of ``nifh-ref.fa`` in ``nifh-db`` folder. (Hint: ``head`` command reads the file from the beginning and ``tail`` command reads the file from the ending)

1.1.2. Show the first 8 lines of ``corn.fa`` in ``metags`` folder

1.1.3. Get the total number of nitrogen fixation gene sequences in ``nifh-ref.fa`` file

1.1.4. Get the total number of sequences in the ``corn.fa`` file in ``metags`` folder

**Solution**:

1.1.1. Command::

	tail -40 nifh_db/nifh-ref.fa

1.1.2. Command::

	head -8 metags/corn.fa


1.1.3. There are 50 nifh gene seqeuces in ``nifh-db/nifh-ref.fa``. Command::

	grep "^>" nifh_db/nifh-ref.fa | wc -l

1.1.4. There are 8948 sequences in ``metags/corn.fa``. Command::

	grep "^>" metags/corn.fa | wc -l


Project 2. Apply BLAST on real datasets
=======================================
You should already be in the folder of Project 2 if you just finished "Exercise 1.1". If not, navigate to ``big_blast`` directory by::

	cd /home/ubuntu/blast_crash_course/materials/blast-tutorial/data/big_blast

Task 2.1. Explore the data
--------------------------

**What are in this folder?**

Let's see what we have in this folder::

	ls
	ls *	# List all subdirectories


- ``nifh_db/``: a folder contains nucleotide sequence file for nitrogen fixation genes ``nifh-ref.fa`` --- **database**

- ``metags/``: a folder contains metagenome files from three different Iowa crop soils (``corn.fa``, ``soybean.fa``, and ``prairie.fa``) --- **query**

- **Objective**: Identify the existence of nitrogen fixation genes in soil metagenome files

In reality, database is not limited to functional genes of bacteria that we are using here. It can be a database of nucleotide or amino acid sequences that you would like to compare your query sequences with, for example: reference genome. At NCBI, ``nr`` is a database of protein sequences and ``nt`` is a nucleotide database. You can find more information on how to download these databases from `here
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537770/>`_.

The same with query: query is not limited to metagenomes as shown in this tutorial. It can be any nucleotide or amino acid sequences, such as gene sequences generated from your lab.


**How many sequences are there in the fasta file?**

You already have some information about data in this folder after "Exercise 1.1":

* There are 50 nifh gene seqeuces in ``nifh-db/nifh-ref.fa``

* There are 8948 sequences in ``metags/corn.fa``

We practiced getting the total number of sequences of ``metags/corn.fa`` by using ``grep "^>" metags/corn.fa | wc -l``. But we may also be interested in the number of sequences in ``metags/prairie.fa`` and ``metags/soybean.fa`` separately. We can efficiently get the total number of sequences for every fasta files in ``metags/`` folder using a ``for`` loop. This can be helpful when there are a large number of metagenome fasta files in the folder::

	 for x in metags/*.fa; do echo $x; grep "^>" $x | wc -l; done


Task 2.2. Make database
-----------------------
We want to find the existence of nifh genes in soil metagenome samples. Making a database for nifh genes is a smart way to index the gene sequences so that it can search and compare metagenome sequences (query) with nifh gene sequences much faster.

To make a database of nifh gene sequences:: 

    # Usage: makeblastdb -in <nifh-db> -dbtype nucl -out <nifh-db>
    
    cd /home/ubuntu/blast_crash_course/materials/blast-tutorial/data/big_blast
    makeblastdb -in nifh_db/nifh-ref.fa -dbtype nucl -out nifh_db/nifh-ref.fa

    # the database looks like:
    ls nifh_db/

Task 2.3. BLAST
---------------
Now we can BLAST the metagenome files to nifh gene database. I would suggest something like the following variables, note that the ``-outfmt 6`` flag identifies a tabular output::

    # Usage: blastn -query <metag file> -db <db file> -out <name of output> -outfmt 6
    
    cd /home/ubuntu/blast_crash_course/materials/blast-tutorial/data/big_blast
    
    blastn -query metags/corn.fa -db nifh_db/nifh-ref.fa -out metags/corn.fa-blast-output.txt -outfmt 6

Make sure you've created a BLAST output for each of the metagenomes in the tutorial. This can be done with a ``for`` loop::

	rm metags/corn.fa-blast-output.txt

    for x in metags/*.fa; do blastn -query $x -db nifh_db/nifh-ref.fa -out $x-blast-output.txt -outfmt 6; done



Task 2.4. Play around BLAST output
----------------------------------
Let's first navigate to the folder with BLAST output::

	cd metags
	ls

We may be interested in::

1. How does the BLAST output file look like::

	head corn.fa-blast-output.txt

2. How many times in total did metagenome sequences hit nifh genes for each soil metagenome to your database::

	# how many lines within each BLAST output file:
	for y in *.txt; do wc -l $y; done

3. How many uniq nifh genes were hit by sequences from soybean metagenome::

	cut -f 2 soybean.fa-blast-output.txt | sort | uniq | wc -l
	cut -f 2 soybean.fa-blast-output.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort

4. How many uniq sequences from prairie metagenome can hit nifh genes::

	cut -f 1 prairie.fa-blast-output.txt | sort | uniq | wc -l

5. How to get the ``sseqid``, ``sstart``, and ``send`` column (column 2, 9, 10) from the soybean blast output file::

	cut -f 2,9,10 soybean.fa-blast-output.txt


6. How many times was gene ``gi|909637271|emb|LN713523.1|`` hit by sequences from corn metagenome sample::

	grep "gi|909637271|emb|LN713523.1|" corn.fa-blast-output.txt | wc -l
	# extract column 1, 3, and 5 by `cut`:
	#cut -f 1,3,5 corn.fa-blastn-output.txt



================
Conclusion
================

You now have the foundation for having some sequencing data that you need to compare to any database. You should be able to do some basic search to BLAST output file. Note, that you can do this for specific genes and also genomes…! Now, go forth and conquer!
