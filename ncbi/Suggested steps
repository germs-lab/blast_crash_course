Suggested steps 

1.  Look at the sequence file from seq facility
2.  Identify the database genes (look at it, possibly build it if you think there is time?)
3.  install blast?  i think its a good idea
4.  Run blast (makedb and a blast)
5.  Get output saved
6.  Look at output
7.  Grep something in the output 




PATH: use head / tail, already on the PATH


`which blast`

 Task3: 

 blast is a clever way to index the sequences so that it can search and compare faster

 put a link of outfmt 6

 blastn -help

 type the command


Working with blastn output:
 play with the blastn output
