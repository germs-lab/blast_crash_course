2. Reading and writing files
==================

Let's start by navigating to the ``data`` file within the ``shell-tutorial`` folder.

.. code-block:: shell

	cd ~/blast_crash_course/materials/shell-tutorial/data

You can dump out the contents of the file by using the ``cat`` command. Let's see what's in the ``big-fasta.fa``.


.. code-block:: shell

	cat big-fasta.fa

That's a whole lot of stuff!
